       A  thread's  CPU affinity mask determines the set of CPUs on which it is eligible to run.  On a multiprocessor system, setting the CPU affinity mask
       can be used to obtain performance benefits.  For example, by dedicating one CPU to a particular thread (i.e., setting  the  affinity  mask  of  that
       thread  to specify a single CPU, and setting the affinity mask of all other threads to exclude that CPU), it is possible to ensure maximum execution
       speed for that thread.  Restricting a thread to run on a single CPU also avoids the performance cost caused by the cache  invalidation  that  occurs
       when a thread ceases to execute on one CPU and then recommences execution on a different CPU.

       A  CPU  affinity  mask is represented by the _c_p_u___s_e_t___t structure, a "CPU set", pointed to by _m_a_s_k.  A set of macros for manipulating CPU sets is de‐
       scribed in CCPPUU__SSEETT(3).

       sscchheedd__sseettaaffffiinniittyy() sets the CPU affinity mask of the thread whose ID is _p_i_d to the value specified by _m_a_s_k.  If  _p_i_d  is  zero,  then  the  calling
       thread  is  used.   The  argument  _c_p_u_s_e_t_s_i_z_e is the length (in bytes) of the data pointed to by _m_a_s_k.  Normally this argument would be specified as
       _s_i_z_e_o_f_(_c_p_u___s_e_t___t_).

       If the thread specified by _p_i_d is not currently running on one of the CPUs specified in _m_a_s_k, then that thread is migrated to one of the CPUs speci‐
       fied in _m_a_s_k.

       sscchheedd__ggeettaaffffiinniittyy() writes the affinity mask of the thread whose ID is _p_i_d into the _c_p_u___s_e_t___t structure pointed to by _m_a_s_k.  The _c_p_u_s_e_t_s_i_z_e argument
       specifies the size (in bytes) of _m_a_s_k.  If _p_i_d is zero, then the mask of the calling thread is returned.

       The CPU affinity system calls were introduced in Linux kernel 2.5.8.  The system call wrappers were introduced in glibc 2.3.  Initially,  the  glibc
       interfaces  included  a  _c_p_u_s_e_t_s_i_z_e  argument, typed as _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _i_n_t.  In glibc 2.3.3, the _c_p_u_s_e_t_s_i_z_e argument was removed, but was then restored in
       glibc 2.3.4, with type _s_i_z_e___t.

CCOONNFFOORRMMIINNGG TTOO
       These system calls are Linux-specific.

       After a call to sscchheedd__sseettaaffffiinniittyy(), the set of CPUs on which the thread will actually run is the intersection of the set specified in the _m_a_s_k  ar‐
       gument and the set of CPUs actually present on the system.  The system may further restrict the set of CPUs on which the thread runs if the "cpuset"
       mechanism described in ccppuusseett(7) is being used.  These restrictions on the actual set of CPUs on which the thread will run are silently  imposed  by
       the kernel.

       There  are  various  ways  of  determining  the  number  of CPUs available on the system, including: inspecting the contents of _/_p_r_o_c_/_c_p_u_i_n_f_o; using
       ssyyssccoonnff(3) to obtain the values of the __SSCC__NNPPRROOCCEESSSSOORRSS__CCOONNFF and __SSCC__NNPPRROOCCEESSSSOORRSS__OONNLLNN parameters; and inspecting the list of  CPU  directories  under
       _/_s_y_s_/_d_e_v_i_c_e_s_/_s_y_s_t_e_m_/_c_p_u_/.

       sscchheedd(7) has a description of the Linux scheduling scheme.

       The affinity mask is a per-thread attribute that can be adjusted independently for each of the threads in a thread group.  The value returned from a
       call to ggeettttiidd(2) can be passed in the argument _p_i_d.  Specifying _p_i_d as 0 will set the attribute for the calling thread, and passing the  value  re‐
       turned  from  a call to ggeettppiidd(2) will set the attribute for the main thread of the thread group.  (If you are using the POSIX threads API, then use
       pptthhrreeaadd__sseettaaffffiinniittyy__nnpp(3) instead of sscchheedd__sseettaaffffiinniittyy().)

       The _i_s_o_l_c_p_u_s boot option can be used to isolate one or more CPUs at boot time, so that no processes are scheduled onto those  CPUs.   Following  the
       use  of this boot option, the only way to schedule processes onto the isolated CPUs is via sscchheedd__sseettaaffffiinniittyy() or the ccppuusseett(7) mechanism.  For fur‐
       ther information, see the kernel source file _D_o_c_u_m_e_n_t_a_t_i_o_n_/_a_d_m_i_n_-_g_u_i_d_e_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_-_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s_._t_x_t.  As noted in that  file,  _i_s_o_l_c_p_u_s  is  the  preferred
       mechanism of isolating CPUs (versus the alternative of manually setting the CPU affinity of all processes on the system).

       A child created via ffoorrkk(2) inherits its parent's CPU affinity mask.  The affinity mask is preserved across an eexxeeccvvee(2).

       This  manual  page  describes the glibc interface for the CPU affinity calls.  The actual system call interface is slightly different, with the _m_a_s_k
       being typed as _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _l_o_n_g _*, reflecting the fact that the underlying implementation of CPU sets is a  simple  bit  mask.   On  success,  the  raw
       sscchheedd__ggeettaaffffiinniittyy()  system  call  returns the size (in bytes) of the _c_p_u_m_a_s_k___t data type that is used internally by the kernel to represent the CPU
       set bit mask.

       The underlying system calls (which represent CPU masks as bit masks of type _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _l_o_n_g _*) impose no restriction on the  size  of  the  CPU  mask.
       However,  the  _c_p_u___s_e_t___t data type used by glibc has a fixed size of 128 bytes, meaning that the maximum CPU number that can be represented is 1023.
       If the kernel CPU affinity mask is larger than 1024, then calls of the form:

           sched_getaffinity(pid, sizeof(cpu_set_t), &mask);

       fail with the error EEIINNVVAALL, the error produced by the underlying system call for the case where the _m_a_s_k size specified  in  _c_p_u_s_e_t_s_i_z_e  is  smaller
       than  the size of the affinity mask used by the kernel.  (Depending on the system CPU topology, the kernel affinity mask can be substantially larger
       than the number of active CPUs in the system.)

       When working on systems with large kernel CPU affinity masks, one must dynamically allocate the _m_a_s_k argument (see  CCPPUU__AALLLLOOCC(3)).   Currently,  the
       only  way to do this is by probing for the size of the required mask using sscchheedd__ggeettaaffffiinniittyy() calls with increasing mask sizes (until the call does
       not fail with the error EEIINNVVAALL).

       Be aware that CCPPUU__AALLLLOOCC(3) may allocate a slightly larger CPU set than requested (because CPU sets are implemented as bit masks allocated  in  units
       of  _s_i_z_e_o_f_(_l_o_n_g_)).   Consequently,  sscchheedd__ggeettaaffffiinniittyy()  can set bits beyond the requested allocation size, because the kernel sees a few additional
       bits.  Therefore, the caller should iterate over the bits in the returned set, counting those which are set, and stop upon reaching  the  value  re‐
       turned by CCPPUU__CCOOUUNNTT(3) (rather than iterating over the number of bits requested to be allocated).

       The  program  below  creates  a child process.  The parent and child then each assign themselves to a specified CPU and execute identical loops that
       consume some CPU time.  Before terminating, the parent waits for the child to complete.  The program takes three  command-line  arguments:  the  CPU
       number for the parent, the CPU number for the child, and the number of loop iterations that both processes should perform.

       As  the  sample  runs below demonstrate, the amount of real and CPU time consumed when running the program will depend on intra-core caching effects
       and whether the processes are using the same CPU.

       We first employ llssccppuu(1) to determine that this (x86) system has two cores, each with two CPUs:

           $ llssccppuu || ggrreepp --ii ''ccoorree..**::||ssoocckkeett''
           Thread(s) per core:    2
           Core(s) per socket:    2
           Socket(s):             1

       We then time the operation of the example program for three cases: both processes running on the same CPU; both processes running on different  CPUs
       on the same core; and both processes running on different CPUs on different cores.
